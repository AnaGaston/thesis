# thesis_project_blog_generator
 The is Not a Music Blog: A Python based Markov generator for speculative music blogging
 This is a generator that uses the Markovify library to generate blog posts based on text files scraped from various music blogs. It may be adapted for use with any text file you wish to run through it. 

 To run you will need the textfiles which have been uploaded in a separate zip folder. These are not publically posted and are for the access of my thesis supervisors/assessors only.
